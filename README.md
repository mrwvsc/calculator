# Calculator Program

This is a Python-based calculator program that provides a variety of mathematical and financial calculations. The program is interactive and allows users to choose from different options to perform calculations.

## Features

The program supports the following calculations:

1. **Pythagorean Theorem**: Calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
2. **Area of a Triangle**: Calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.
3. **Area of a Circle**: Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
4. **Circumference of a Circle**: Calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius.
5. **Rounding**: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
6. **Area of a Square/Rectangle**: Calculates the area of a square or rectangle given its length and width.
7. **Area of a Kite**: Calculates the area of a kite given its diagonals.
8. **Compounding and Depreciation**:
   - Simple Compounding
   - Complex Compounding
   - Simple Depreciation
   - Complex Depreciation
9. **Exit**: Exits the program.
